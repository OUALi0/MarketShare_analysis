## Problem

* The client needs `interactive data analysis tools` to explore and analyze their financial data in an `intuitive` and `user-friendly` manner.


## Solution

* We offer a comprehensive `Business Intelligence solution` that includes `automated extraction` and `transformation of financial data` from an unstructured web source, as well as the creation of a `dynamic and regularly updated dashboard`.

* We use Microsoft services such as `SSIS`, `PowerBI`, and `SQL Server` as well as `Python` with its various libraries for Web Scraping and Data Cleaning.

* We will ensure `structured data feeding` and the implementation of an audit dashboard `to track and evaluate` the performance of the solution.
